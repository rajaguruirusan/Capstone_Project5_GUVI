# Capstone_Project5_GUVI
Industrial Copper Modeling Capstone project

#**Project Overview**

# The objective of this project is to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to address key challenges in the copper industry, such as pricing optimization and lead evaluation. The solution focuses on:

* Data-Driven Insights: Analyzing and preprocessing historical data to identify patterns, manage skewness, and handle noisy datasets for improved predictions.
* Regression Model: Predicting the selling price of copper products based on key parameters such as quantity, thickness, and other product attributes to support dynamic pricing strategies.
* Classification Model: Classifying leads into "WON" or "LOST" categories using transactional and customer data, enabling better sales pipeline management.
* Streamlit Application: Developing an interactive web-based application for real-time prediction and decision-making, providing a user-friendly interface for entering input features and obtaining actionable predictions.
* Streamlined Workflows: Incorporating data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization techniques to ensure robust model performance and accurate predictions.
